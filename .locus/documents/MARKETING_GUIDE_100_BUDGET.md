## 1. Why Now: Market Timing is Perfect

The AI coding agent market is exploding in 2026. Here's what makes this the ideal moment for Locus:

- **$7.84B market (2025) projected to reach $52.62B by 2030** at 46.3% CAGR
- **"Vibe Coding" was 2025's word of the year** — developers are actively embracing AI orchestration
- **78% of organizations** have integrated AI into core development workflows
- **Anthropic's 2026 Agentic Coding Trends Report** confirms the shift from single-agent to multi-agent systems entering production
- **The "Day 2" problem** is now the industry focus: maintaining, scaling, and iterating on AI-generated code — exactly what Locus solves with structured sprint planning + local execution

### Locus's Unique Position

Most AI coding tools (Cursor, Copilot, Codex) focus on the **individual developer writing code**. Locus occupies a unique and uncrowded niche: **orchestrating AI agents as a team, with project management built in**. This is the gap between "vibe coding" and "shipping production software." No major competitor offers:

1. Cloud planning + local execution (code never leaves your machine)
2. Multi-agent orchestration with git worktree isolation
3. Telegram-based remote control for 24/7 agent management
4. Sprint planning with AI (Tech Lead, Architect, Sprint Organizer agents)
5. Support for both Claude and Codex as interchangeable providers

## 3. Channel-by-Channel Playbook

### 3.1 Reddit — $40 Budget

**Why:** Reddit's AI coding communities are the #1 place developers discuss and evaluate new tools in 2026. Authentic engagement beats paid ads, but a small boost ensures visibility.

**Target Subreddits (Organic Posts — FREE):**

| Subreddit | Members | Post Type |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| r/programming | 6M+ | "Show" post with demo |
| r/vibecoding | Large | How Locus structures vibe coding into shippable sprints |
| r/ClaudeCode | Large | Integration showcase — Locus + Claude Code |
| r/ChatGPTCoding | Large | Comparison: solo coding vs. multi-agent orchestration |
| r/selfhosted | 400K+ | Self-hosting Locus agents on a VPS |
| r/devops | 200K+ | CI/CD angle: AI agents creating PRs automatically |
| r/SideProject | 100K+ | Building with Locus as an indie dev |

**Paid Strategy ($40):**
- Promote **1 post** in r/programming or r/artificial targeting "AI coding" interest
- Use Reddit's self-serve ads: minimum $5/day for 8 days
- Ad copy angle: *"Your AI agents write code. But who manages them? Locus: AI-native project management where code never leaves your machine."*

**Post Templates:**

**Template A — Show Post (r/programming, r/vibecoding):**
```
Title: I built an open-source tool that manages AI coding agents like a dev team — with sprints, task dispatch, and Telegram control

We've been building Locus — an AI-native project management CLI that lets you:

- Plan sprints with AI (locus plan "build auth system")
- Dispatch tasks to Claude or Codex agents running locally
- Run up to 5 agents in parallel, each in isolated git worktrees
- Control everything from Telegram while away from your desk
- Your code NEVER leaves your machine — only task metadata syncs

The problem we're solving: Vibe coding is great for day 1. But day 2 —
maintaining, coordinating, and shipping — needs structure. Locus adds
sprint planning and multi-agent orchestration without sacrificing the
speed of AI coding.

npm install -g @locusai/cli
Docs: https://docs.locusai.dev

Would love feedback from anyone running AI agents in production.
```

**Template B — Problem/Solution Post (r/selfhosted, r/devops):**
```
Title: Self-hosted AI coding agents that run 24/7 and create PRs autonomously — controlled from Telegram

Tired of babysitting AI coding sessions? We built Locus to run AI agents
on your own server, fully autonomously.

How it works:
1. Create sprints & tasks in the web dashboard
2. Agents claim tasks, work in isolated git worktrees
3. PRs appear on GitHub when done
4. Review and control everything from Telegram

Security-first: source code never touches the cloud. Only task metadata
syncs. Agents run on YOUR infrastructure.

Setup: curl -fsSL https://locusai.dev/install.sh | bash

Has anyone else been experimenting with autonomous AI agent setups?
```

### 3.2 X (Twitter) — $30 Budget

**Why:** Developer Twitter is where "AI coding" discourse happens in real-time. $30 gets ~60-150 link clicks at $0.20-0.50 CPC.

**Organic Strategy (FREE):**

Post a **thread** from the @locusai account (or founder's personal account for higher engagement):

**Thread Structure:**
```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
The AI coding stack is missing a critical layer.

Cursor writes code. Copilot suggests code. Claude builds features.

But who *manages* the AI agents?

Meet Locus — AI-native project management where your code never
leaves your machine. 🧵

Tweet 2 (Problem):
The "Day 2" problem in AI coding:

Day 1: "AI built my entire app in 20 minutes!"
Day 2: "Wait, which AI changed what? How do I coordinate 3 agents?
Where do I track progress?"

This is what Locus solves.

Tweet 3 (Demo):
With Locus:

$ locus plan "build user authentication"
→ AI team (Tech Lead + Architect + Sprint Organizer) creates a sprint

$ locus run --agents 3
→ 3 agents work in parallel, each on a separate task, in isolated
git worktrees
→ PRs appear on GitHub automatically

Tweet 4 (Security angle):
The best part: your code NEVER leaves your machine.

Locus syncs only task metadata (titles, statuses, priorities)
with the cloud.

All AI execution happens locally. Self-host on your own server
for 24/7 operation.

Tweet 5 (CTA):
Try it now:
npm install -g @locusai/cli

Works with Claude (Anthropic) and Codex (OpenAI).

Docs: https://docs.locusai.dev
Dashboard: https://app.locusai.dev

What would you build with a team of AI agents?
```

**Paid Strategy ($30):**
- Promote Tweet 1 (the hook tweet) for 6 days at $5/day
- Target interests: "software development," "artificial intelligence," "open source"
- Engagement objective (optimizes for retweets + replies, better than link clicks for dev tools)

**Hashtags to Use:**
`#VibeCoding` `#AICoding` `#DevTools` `#ClaudeCode` `#OpenSource` `#AIAgents`

**First Comment (from maker):**
```
Hey PH! 👋

We built Locus because we were frustrated with the gap between "vibe
coding" and shipping production software.

AI agents are incredible at writing code. But coordinating multiple
agents, tracking progress, and maintaining quality? That's a project
management problem.

Locus treats AI agents like team members — they claim tasks from sprints,
work in isolated environments, and submit PRs when done.

The key architectural decision: your source code NEVER leaves your
infrastructure. We only sync task metadata. This was non-negotiable
for us.

Would love to hear how you're managing AI coding agents today!
```

### 3.4 Hacker News "Show HN" — FREE

**Why:** HN is the single most valuable free channel for dev tools. A successful "Show HN" post can drive 10K-50K visits and establish long-term SEO authority.

**Post:**
```
Title: Show HN: Locus – AI-native project management where code stays local

URL: https://locusai.dev (or https://github.com/asgarovf/locusai)

Text:
Locus separates cloud planning from local execution for AI coding
agents. You create sprints and tasks in a web dashboard, then AI
agents (Claude or Codex) execute them on your machine in isolated
git worktrees.

Key decisions:
- Source code never leaves your infrastructure (only task metadata syncs)
- Multi-agent: up to 5 agents working in parallel on separate tasks
- AI planning: "locus plan" orchestrates Tech Lead + Architect + Sprint
  Organizer agents to create sprints
- Telegram bot for remote control (start agents, review tasks, run git
  commands from your phone)
- Self-hostable on any Linux/macOS/Windows server

Tech: TypeScript monorepo, NestJS API, Next.js dashboard, Node CLI

npm install -g @locusai/cli
Docs: https://docs.locusai.dev
```

**Timing:** Post between 8-10 AM EST on a weekday (Tuesday-Thursday)

**Engagement Rules:**
- Respond to every comment within 1 hour
- Be transparent about limitations
- Share architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Never be defensive about criticism

---

---

## 4. Messaging Strategy: Key Angles by Audience

### Angle 1: "Code Never Leaves Your Machine" (Security-Conscious Devs)
> *"Every other AI tool uploads your code to the cloud. Locus doesn't. Your agents run locally. Only task metadata syncs. Period."*

**Why it works:** Privacy is the #1 concern on Reddit threads about AI coding tools. Devs frequently ask "does this tool train on my code?" — Locus has a definitive answer.

### Angle 2: "Vibe Coding → Production Shipping" (Indie Hackers & Startups)
> *"Vibe coding gets you from 0 to prototype. Locus gets you from prototype to production — with sprints, multi-agent coordination, and automated PRs."*

**Why it works:** Taps directly into the biggest trend of 2025-2026. Positions Locus as the missing piece, not a replacement.

### Angle 3: "AI Agents as Team Members" (Engineering Leads & CTOs)
> *"What if your AI agents had a standup? Locus assigns tasks, tracks progress, and creates PRs — just like a well-organized dev team."*

**Why it works:** Engineering leaders are looking for ways to integrate AI agents into existing workflows, not replace them.

### Angle 4: "Manage Agents from Your Phone" (Remote / Async Workers)
> *"Deploy Locus on a $10/mo VPS and manage your entire AI dev team from Telegram. Plan sprints, dispatch tasks, review PRs — all from your phone."*

**Why it works:** The Telegram integration is a genuinely unique feature that competitors don't offer.

---

## 9. Competitive Positioning Cheat Sheet

When people ask "how is this different from X?":

| Competitor | Locus Differentiator |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Cursor / Copilot** | They help you write code. Locus manages teams of AI agents writing code. Different layer. |
| **Linear / Jira** | They manage human developers. Locus is built for AI agents — with dispatch, worktree isolation, and autonomous execution. |
| **Devin** | Devin runs in the cloud (your code leaves your machine). Locus runs locally. You choose the AI provider. |
| **Claude Code / Codex CLI** | These are the engines. Locus is the orchestration layer on top — sprint planning, multi-agent, Telegram control. |
| **ClickUp AI / Asana AI** | They added AI features to human PM tools. Locus was built AI-native from day one. |

---

## 10. Key Talking Points Summary

Use these in every post, comment, and conversation:

1. **"Code never leaves your machine"** — the #1 differentiator, lead with this always
2. **"AI agents as team members"** — sprints, tasks, dispatch, PRs — the workflow developers already know
3. **"5 agents in parallel"** — concrete, impressive, easy to understand
4. **"Control from Telegram"** — unique feature that captures imagination
5. **"Works with Claude AND Codex"** — no vendor lock-in, developer freedom
6. **"2 minutes to get started"** — npm install + locus init, low friction
