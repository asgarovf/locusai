# Learnings

This file captures important lessons, decisions, and corrections made during development.
It is read by AI agents before every task to avoid repeating mistakes and to follow established patterns.

<!-- Add learnings below this line. Format: - **[Category]**: Description -->
- **[Architecture]**: The VSCode extension invokes the CLI as `locus --json-stream --session-id <id> -- <prompt>`, where `--json-stream` is the first positional arg (argv[2]). The CLI's main() must detect this and route to `execCommand` since it's not a named subcommand. *The extension and CLI must agree on flag names (e.g., `--session-id` vs `--session`).*
- **[Debugging]**: The `@swc/helpers` package is not properly linked by Bun's package manager in this repo. The `jest.config.js` overrides `externalHelpers: false` in the SWC transform options to work around this. Without this override, all tests fail with "Cannot find module '@swc/helpers/_/_ts_decorate'".
- **[Patterns]**: Test files in `apps/api` use the `.jest.ts` extension (not `.spec.ts` or `.test.ts`). Always import `reflect-metadata` and `../../test-setup` at the top of test files before other imports. Entity mocks for TypeORM are defined in `apps/api/src/test-setup.ts`.
- **[Architecture]**: The CLI binary is `locus`, not `locus-agent` (`locus-agent` is the default OS username on provisioned servers). To upgrade the CLI on instances, run `sudo locus upgrade` — not `curl | bash`. The `locus upgrade` command handles npm cache cleaning, version checking, and `npm install -g` for all `@locusai/*` packages.
- **[DevOps]**: The Locus service (Telegram bot + proposal scheduler) is managed via `locus service install/uninstall/status`. On Linux it's a systemd service (`/etc/systemd/system/locus.service`), on macOS it's a LaunchAgent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.locus.agent.plist`). The standalone `locus daemon` command was removed — proposal scheduling is now embedded in the Telegram bot process via `ProposalScheduler`.
- **[Debugging]**: Telegraf's `bot.launch()` must use `{ dropPendingUpdates: true }` to prevent re-processing old commands after a restart. Without this, commands like `/upgrade` that trigger a service restart will loop because the bot picks up the same `/upgrade` update from Telegram's queue on restart.
- **[Patterns]**: The CLI interactive REPL uses a custom raw-mode `InputHandler` (in `packages/cli/src/repl/input-handler.ts`) instead of `readline.createInterface`. This enables Shift+Enter for newlines, bracketed paste mode for multi-line paste, and input locking during agent execution. Any new interactive prompts should use `InputHandler` rather than `readline`.
- **[Debugging]**: In raw mode (`process.stdin.setRawMode(true)`), `OPOST` is disabled so `\n` in stdout is just LF (no carriage return). Always use `\r\n` for line breaks in terminal rendering. Also, ANSI color escape sequences (e.g., from `c.cyan()`) inflate `.length` but are invisible — use `str.replace(/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m/g, "")` to get visual width for terminal column calculations.
- **[Patterns]**: When aborting an AI runner process (`abort()`), set an `aborted` flag so the `close` handler can distinguish user-initiated interrupts from real errors. Without this, SIGTERM exits (code 143) produce confusing error messages like "CLI exited with code 143".
- **[Patterns]**: The CLI detects image file paths in user input (pasted screenshots, etc.) via `packages/cli/src/repl/image-detect.ts`. It handles macOS escaped-space paths (`Screenshot\ 2026-02-21.png`), unescaped paths, quoted paths, and `~/` expansion. Detected images are copied to a stable temp dir (`/tmp/locus-images/`) and the stable copy path is used in Read tool instructions, since macOS temp files can be deleted before Claude reads them.
- **[Debugging]**: Image path detection uses pattern-based detection (does NOT require `existsSync`). However, when a file DOES exist, it's copied to `/tmp/locus-images/` for stability. Read tool instructions are only included for files that exist (using the stable copy path). The `buildImageContext()` function filters to existing images only.
- **[DevOps]**: The CLI is bundled with `bun build` into a single `packages/cli/bin/locus.js` file. After modifying TypeScript source, always run `bun run build` in `packages/cli/` to rebuild. Running `tsc --noEmit` only type-checks — it does NOT produce the bundle. The bundle uses `__esm()` lazy initializers for module-scoped variables.
- **[DevOps]**: nvm does NOT create a `~/.nvm/current` symlink. The correct way to find nvm binaries is to scan `~/.nvm/versions/node/` and resolve the active version via `process.versions.node`, `~/.nvm/alias/default`, or highest installed version. The service PATH and telegram `env.ts` now use proper nvm resolution. The service install also detects `claude` binary location at install time via `which claude`.
- **[Debugging]**: `locus service uninstall` must explicitly `pkill -f locus-telegram` after `launchctl unload`/`systemctl stop`. The service stop commands can fail silently or race with `KeepAlive`/`Restart=on-failure`, leaving orphaned bot processes that keep responding on Telegram. Always force-kill as a safety net.
