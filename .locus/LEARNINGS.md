# Learnings

This file captures important lessons, decisions, and corrections made during development.
It is read by AI agents before every task to avoid repeating mistakes and to follow established patterns.

<!-- Add learnings below this line. Format: - **[Category]**: Description -->
- **[User Preferences]**: Do not record low-level implementation details or one-time fixes in learnings. Focus on architectural decisions, package ownership, and explicit user preference overrides — entries that help any future agent on any task, not just the current one.
