Great, I now have a solid understanding of the project. You already have a fairly mature dual auth system in place — JWT with email/OTP and Google OAuth for the web dashboard, plus SHA-256 hashed API keys for CLI agents and integrations.

So my first question: **When you say "how should we structure the auth system," are you thinking about rearchitecting what already exists, or is there a specific gap or scaling concern you're running into with the current setup?** For example, are you hitting issues around permission granularity, multi-workspace access control, token refresh flows, or something else entirely?
