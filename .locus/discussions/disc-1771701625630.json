You've raised two really important challenges — the steep learning curve and the differentiation question against Claude Code/Codex directly.\n\nLet me start with the differentiation angle since it's the more existential one. Looking at what Locus does today — it wraps Claude and Codex CLIs, adds session management, a REPL with multi-line input, image detection, and an orchestration layer with plans, learnings, and artifacts — **who specifically has told you \"I wish Claude Code did X\" where X is something Locus already solves?** In other words, what's the concrete pain point you've seen users hit with raw Claude Code that made them reach for Locus instead?",

      "content": "I've done a deep dive into both your codebase and the competitive landscape. Here's what I found:\n\n**What Locus genuinely has that nobody else does:**\n\nThe **discuss → insights → plan → execute → review** pipeline. No other tool in the market takes a natural conversation, extracts structured decisions/requirements, feeds them into AI-driven sprint planning, then executes tasks with those decisions as persistent context. Kiro comes closest with \"spec-driven development,\" but it requires you to manually write specification documents. Locus generates structured specs *from conversation* — that's a fundamentally different (and more natural) workflow.\n\n**What's already commoditized (and therefore NOT your moat):**\n\n- Wrapping Claude/Codex CLI (anyone can do this)\n- Session management and REPL (Claude Code already has `--continue`/`--resume`)\n- CLAUDE.md-style project context (Claude Code does this natively)\n- Git automation (GitHub Actions, Copilot Workspace, and even Cursor all do this)\n- Code review (Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf all have this)\n\n**The hard truth:** About 60-70% of Locus's current feature set is racing against features that Claude Code and Codex are building natively. The wrapping layer gets thinner every month.\n\n**But the market gap is real:** Developer trust in AI code dropped from 40% to 29% year-over-year. 65% cite missing context as the #1 problem. Only 17% say agents have improved *team* collaboration. The industry is building faster hammers while teams still can't coordinate which nails to hit.\n\nHere's my sharpest question for you: **Are your actual users (or target users) solo developers who want a better Claude Code wrapper, or are they teams who need to coordinate AI-driven development across multiple people?** Because the answer to that completely changes whether you should double down on the orchestration/planning/discussion layer (team play) or pivot toward something else entirely. Who's been using Locus, and what did they actually use it for?",

Running a terminal agent on a server is also costly since I run it on AWS EC2 large instance because these tools require too much resource. Therefore, I am having trouble to find the impact in this project overall.

The local `locus exec` is a commodity, but **dispatching AI tasks asynchronously from your phone and coming back to structured results** — that's something Claude Code and Codex literally cannot do.\n\nThe cost problem is interesting though, because it points to a deployment model issue, not a product issue. If the unique value is \"AI dev tasks I can fire and forget from anywhere,\" the question becomes whether that has to run on a beefy EC2 instance or if there's a lighter-weight way to deliver it.\n\n**Here's what I want to understand:** When you use the Telegram remote control, what does a typical task look like? Is it \"fix this bug,\" \"implement this feature,\" or more like \"review this PR,\" \"plan the next sprint\" — what are you actually sending from your phone?",

Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot — they all assume you're sitting at a keyboard coding alongside the AI. You're describing something closer to **managing an AI employee** — give it a task, it works, it ships, you just approve. That's a category of one right now.\n\nHere's what I want to drill into: **When the agent creates a PR and you go to manually merge it, what are you actually checking before you hit merge?** Are you reading every line of code, or are you mostly checking that tests pass and the description makes sense?

Every AI dev tool today — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex — is a **reactive instrument**. You described wanting an **autonomous engineering partner** that maintains its own backlog, proposes next steps, and keeps the product evolving even when you're not actively thinking about it.\n\nHere's my question: **If the agent pinged you on Telegram tomorrow morning with \"Based on our roadmap and recent changes, here are 3 things I'd suggest we tackle next — approve one or tell me something different,\" would that actually change how you work?** Or is there something else beyond just proposing tasks that \"continuous development\" means to you?",

You're not building a dev tool — you're building a **synthetic engineering team for solo founders**. The question then becomes: what does \"the team kept working while I was away\" actually look like when you open Telegram in the morning? Is it seeing completed PRs waiting for your approval, or is it more about seeing a feed of activity — \"analyzed codebase, found 3 issues, proposed fix for one, drafted plan for a new feature\" — like reading a team's Slack channel when you wake up?",

That's compelling — but it's also a big jump from where Locus is today. \n\n**If you were going to build the smallest possible version of this \"always-on engineering partner\" to prove the concept works — the thing that would make you open Telegram in the morning and feel that momentum — what's the ONE capability it would need to have that it doesn't have today?**",

Here's what needs your attention.\"\n\n4. **Fire-and-forget task execution** — You text the agent \"add dark mode to the settings page,\" walk away, and come back to a merged PR with a Telegram message: \"Done. Dark mode is live on staging. Here's what I changed.\"\n\nWhich of these — or what combination — would make you open Telegram and think \"my team has been working\"?",

So the question isn't \"which one\" — it's **what's the right sequence to build them in so that each layer makes the next one more powerful?** \n\nFor example, if you build the autonomous code health maintenance first (nightly scans, auto-fixes), that gives you the activity feed for free — because every autonomous action generates a Telegram notification. Then proactive proposals become easier because the agent already has context from its nightly analysis.

This \"always-on engineering partner\" vision requires the agent to run *continuously* — nightly scans, repo monitoring, proactive analysis. **That makes the cost problem significantly worse, not better.** A nightly cron job that spins up Claude to analyze your codebase, fix things, and propose next steps could easily burn through API credits fast.\n\n**How do you think about solving the cost problem for an always-on agent — do you see this as something that runs on a schedule (e.g., nightly batch), runs continuously on a server, or is there a lighter-weight architecture you've been considering?**",

Skipped items are permanently dismissed, and items you've seen but haven't responded to should have a TTL — if you don't reply within, say, 24 hours, they auto-expire and won't resurface.\n\nInline buttons are the right call for Telegram — they make the interaction feel lightweight and mobile-native. Something like `[Fix] [Skip] [Details]` keeps the cognitive load minimal.\n\nThis actually raises an interesting design question: **Where should this suggestion state be stored — locally on the server running the agent, or somewhere persistent like a database or even a simple JSON file synced to the repo?** The answer matters because if the agent's server restarts or you move it to a different machine, you don't want all your \"skip\" decisions to be lost and the agent to start resurfacing everything again.",

If the agent runs per-repo but the state lives in a shared cloud API, you could potentially get a unified Telegram feed across all your projects — \"Project A: fixed 2 tests. Project B: suggests adding caching to the API.

The next logical step would be turning Phase 1 (autonomous code health maintenance) into a concrete technical plan — but that's for whenever you're ready to start building.",
