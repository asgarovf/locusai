  "directive": "I feel like we are on the good track, but the landing page and docs are not clearly showing what we are doing. So the strongest parts of our tool (Locus) is that it unifies the interactions with multiple AI clients and they have the unified interface (1), it github native so you can use AI combined with github as database to make stuff more interesting (2), also the built in tools that we created so far is really helpful in addition to using Claude/Codex as raw cli tool (3), also the automation can be done since Locus runs on auto-approval mode",

      "body": "## Overview\n\nCreate a single source of truth for how Locus is described across the landing page and documentation.\n\n## Problem\n\nCurrent messaging is not explicit enough about the product's strongest differentiators. Teams are describing Locus in different ways, which weakens clarity and conversion.\n\n## Scope\n\n- Define the primary value proposition sentence for Locus.\n- Define four canonical pillars and one-line explanations for each:\n  - Unified interface across multiple AI clients.\n  - GitHub-native workflows where GitHub acts as operational memory/database.\n  - Built-in tools that extend beyond raw Claude/Codex CLI usage.\n  - Automation via auto-approval mode.\n- Write a claim-to-evidence matrix mapping each pillar to concrete product behaviors, commands, and examples.\n- Define approved terminology and phrases to avoid (copy style guardrails).\n- Add a short \"positioning brief\" doc in the repo that landing/docs authors can reuse.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- New messaging brief document in docs/content directory.\n- Reusable section snippets for landing hero, feature cards, and docs overview.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] A single messaging brief exists in-repo and is referenced by both landing and docs tasks.\n- [ ] All four pillars are documented with clear claims and concrete evidence.\n- [ ] The brief includes a terminology table (preferred terms and disallowed ambiguous terms).\n- [ ] The brief is concise enough to be consumed in under 10 minutes by a contributor.\n- [ ] Product owner review confirms that the brief reflects intended positioning.",
