These should be cleaned up.\n\n## Types to remove\n\n1. **`CommandResult`** (interface) — Completely unused anywhere in the codebase. Definition:\n   ```ts\n   interface CommandResult { success: boolean; message?: string; error?: string; }\n   ```\n\n2. **`GitHubConfig`** (interface) — Never directly imported. Only used inline within the `LocusConfig` interface definition in the same file. Should be inlined as an anonymous type within `LocusConfig`.\n\n3. **`AIConfig`** (interface) — Never directly imported. Only used inline within the `LocusConfig` interface definition in the same file. Should be inlined as an anonymous type within `LocusConfig`.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `CommandResult` interface is removed entirely\n- [ ] `GitHubConfig` is inlined into `LocusConfig` (its fields placed directly in the `github` property type)\n- [ ] `AIConfig` is inlined into `LocusConfig` (its fields placed directly in the `ai` property type)\n- [ ] No compile errors from the changes\n- [ ] Project builds successfully (`npm run build:cli`)\n- [ ] Tests pass (`npm test`)",
