title: Workflows & Concepts

Locus automates the software development lifecycle by introducing autonomous agents that work alongside you. Understanding the core workflows will help you get the most out of the platform.

## The Agent Lifecycle

Agents in Locus follow a strict lifecycle to ensure quality and safety.

### 1. Backlog & Assignment
Tasks start in the **Backlog**. When you run `locus run`, the agent asks the Cloud for work.
- The Cloud dispatches the highest priority task (Critical > High > Medium > Low).
- The agent "claims" the task and its status moves to **Working**.

### 2. Planning
Before writing code, the agent enters a **Planning Phase**.
- It reads the task description, your `CLAUDE.md` context, and the codebase index.
- It formulates a plan of action.
- *Note:* If you provide a detailed technical design in the task description, the agent will follow it.

### 3. Execution
The agent executes the plan locally on your machine.
- It can modify files, create new files, and delete files.
- It can run terminal commands (like `npm install` or `bun test`) if they are relevant to the task.

### 4. Verification
Once the agent believes it has finished, it doesn't just mark the task as "Done". It moves it to **Verification**.
- This is a safety mechanism. The agent commits its changes locally.
- YOU are expected to review the changes (e.g., via a Pull Request or local diff).
- If the changes are good, you mark the task as **Done**.
- If not, you can reject the task with feedback, sending it back to the agent.

## Sprint Planning & Mindmaps

Locus uses **Sprints** to group related tasks. But an agent needs to understand the "big picture" of a sprint, not just individual tasks.

### The Mindmap
When an agent starts working on a sprint, it first checks if a **Mindmap** exists.
- A Mindmap is a high-level technical summary of the entire sprint's goals.
- If one doesn't exist (or is outdated), the agent will pause to **generate a new Mindmap**.
- It analyzes all tasks in the sprint and creates a cohesive strategy.
- This Mindmap is then injected into the context of *every* task in that sprint, ensuring consistency across different tasks.

## Artifacts

During execution, agents might generate "Artifacts".
- **What are they?** Technical documents, diagrams, or plans generated by the agent.
- **Where do they live?** `.locus/artifacts/` in your project root.
- **Syncing:** Locus automatically syncs these artifacts to the Web Dashboard under the "Artifacts" documentation group, so you can view them easily.
