# Landing Copy Source

Use [`docs/content/positioning-brief.md`](../../../../../docs/content/positioning-brief.md) as the canonical messaging source for landing-page text.

- Hero copy: use the "Landing Hero Snippet"
- Feature cards: use the "Landing Feature Card Snippets (4 Canonical Cards)"
- Terminology choices: follow "Terminology Guardrails"

If this file conflicts with the positioning brief, the positioning brief wins.
