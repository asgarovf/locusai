          <strong className="text-white">Locus</strong> is an open-source CLI
          tool that provides a unified interface for AI-powered software
          engineering across Claude and Codex. It uses GitHub issues, milestones,
          and PRs as its operational backend, enabling teams to plan sprints,
          execute tasks with AI agents, and iterate on feedback without switching
          tools. Locus runs entirely on your machine — your code and prompts
          never touch external servers.
